Gas-Free Blockchain Transactions

Abstract
CirclePay aims to simplify and democratize access to blockchain technology by addressing two of its most significant barriers: transaction fees and user complexity. By utilizing ad-sponsored gas fees and enabling senders to cover transaction costs, we aim to make blockchain transactions as accessible as traditional financial systems, opening Web3 to a broader audience, including first-time users and those with little to no blockchain experience.

Introduction
Blockchain technology offers immense potential in enabling decentralized finance and global transactions. However, the high cost of transaction fees (gas fees), combined with the complexity of managing digital wallets, has made it difficult for the average user to fully embrace this innovation. As Web3 continues to evolve, platforms need to address these challenges to facilitate widespread adoption. Our solution provides a seamless, user-friendly experience that eliminates gas fees for end users and supports the global expansion of blockchain technology.

Challenges in Blockchain Mass adoption

    1. High Transaction Fees: Traditional blockchain networks, including Ethereum, have transaction fees that can range from $0.05 to $50 per transaction, depending on network congestion. Although Layer 2 (L2) solutions and Layer 1 blockchains like Solana and NEAR have significantly reduced these fees to $0.05–$0.10, they still remain a barrier for mass adoption, especially for users accustomed to fee-free bank transfers.
    2. Complex Onboarding Process: New users often face difficulty understanding how to create wallets, fund them with native currency (e.g., ETH, SOL), and manage gas fees. This complexity acts as a barrier for entry to the Web3 space, especially for individuals without prior blockchain experience.
    3. Limited Local Impact: Most blockchain transactions, while enabling global transfers, focus on international payments. However, the majority of users prioritize free or low-cost domestic transactions, making traditional banking systems far more attractive for everyday use.

CirclePay solution
CirclePay simplifies blockchain transactions by addressing the key challenges of high fees and use complexity.

    1. Gas-Free Transactions for Users
    Ad-Supported Gas Fees: Users can engage in token transactions without worrying about the cost of gas fees. This is made possible by watching short sponsor ads, with sponsors covering the transaction costs.
    Sender-Paid Fees: Additionally, senders have the option to pay the gas fees on behalf of the recipient. For example, if a new Web3 user with a fresh wallet receives USDC from another user, they can immediately spend it using their Visa or Mastercard for purchases, transfer it to another wallet, or deposit it into a crypto exchange, all without having to fund their wallet with native currency for gas fees. 
    This makes the process seamless for first-time users, who can interact with blockchain technology just as easily as traditional financial systems.

    2. Simplified User Experience
    Our platform removes the need for users to manually manage their wallets for gas fee payments. By allowing senders to cover transaction costs or using ads as a funding mechanism, we eliminate the complexity and friction typically associated with blockchain transactions.

Market Opportunity
The potential for our platform to disrupt the current blockchain landscape is immense. As of 2023, daily global banking transactions exceed 31.45 billion in number, with a value of $80.1 trillion. While blockchain transactions are currently a small fraction of this volume, the blockchain market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 87.1% and could reach a size of $1.59 trillion by 2030. With this expansion, blockchain solutions that eliminate gas fees and streamline transactions will become increasingly attractive to a global user base​.

User Savings Potential
By offering gas-free transactions, our platform could save users billions annually. For example:

    If a typical user completes 50 transactions per month, each saving ~$0.10 in gas fees, the total annual savings would be $60 per user.
    Extrapolating this to 100 million users by 2030, the aggregate savings could reach $6 billion annually.

Advertising and Sponsorship
CirclePay also offers an innovative advertising model. Sponsors can target relevant user demographics without relying on ineffective, broad ad targeting. Users have the option to choose which ads they would like to watch, enhancing engagement and ensuring that sponsors' budgets are spent more effectively. This creates a win-win scenario for both users and advertisers, increasing the overall utility and value proposition of our platform.
Conclusion
CirclePay solution addresses the major barriers to adoption in the Web3 space: high gas fees and user complexity. By offering gas-free transactions through ad sponsorship and allowing senders to cover fees for recipients, we create an inclusive environment that makes blockchain accessible to all users, from newcomers to experienced participants.
As the blockchain market continues to grow, CirclePay is uniquely positioned to capture a significant share by offering a user-friendly, cost-efficient solution. With the potential to save billions annually on transaction fees and create new opportunities for advertisers, our platform has the ability to transform how users interact with decentralized finance, paving the way for mass adoption of Web3 technologies.
